# Thermostat-Embedded-Device

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project was to develop a prototype of a thermostat to showcase skills of the developer for a potental position in a company. We similuated a thermostat also sending data over wifi to other devices that would possibly work in conjuction with this device. 

What did you do particularly well?
The program developed for the task scheduler worked very well and all of the requirements for this project were met. Areas where I excelled also include the diagrams created for understanding the machine/device details as well as the technical paper for describing how the device works. 

Where could you improve?
Although it was not a requirement for the item, in some of the previous milestones for the project, it would have been better to code with more specifics or input validation. 

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
I've downloaded the resources from this course in order to have them for easy access in future courses/work. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
The ability to work with embeded devices and have a basic understanding of how to configure hardware. 

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The code was written to be as clear as possible. Comments were used to describe different portions of the code and what they are responsible for. The code can later be manipulated to change basic functions of the "button pushes" or "thermostat readings".
